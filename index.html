                    <h3>Rice Education of the Future Initiative</h3>
                    <p>Stemming from the Student Vision for the Second Century (SV2C), and the Innovation in Undergraduate Teaching (IUT) working group, the Rice Education of the Future (REF) initiative was chartered in October 2014 by the Student Association to address key aspects of the undergraduate experience, including academics, extracurriculars, mentorship, and social life. It has been geared toward aligning the Rice experience with the current priorities and needs of students through the consideration of the following two questions: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>How can we change the holistic Rice experience to include the activities and experiences students derive the most value from, preparing them for the challenges of the 21st century?</li>
                            <li>How can we do this in a way that re-aligns the current Rice experience, rather than adding to and overwhelming it?</li>
                        </ol>
                    <a href="http://sa.rice.edu/ref/">Read more about REF here. </a></p>

                    <h3>Student Association Working Group on Innovation in Undergraduate Teaching (IUT WG)</h3>
                    <p>Charge: The IUT WG was charged by the Student Association (SA) Senate to develop,
communicate and issue recommendations on emerging topics falling under the umbrella of
innovation in undergraduate teaching, including teaching excellence, the use of technology to
enhance the undergraduate experience, and the external use of digital education including
‘massive open online courses’ (MOOCs).</p>

<p>Committee Membership: Ravi Sheth (Chair, SA EVP), Yuan Chang, Hannah Chen, Michael
Donatti (Duncan Senator), Fran Iyer (Undergraduate Representative, University Committee on
Teaching), Sawyer Knight, Josh Lipschultz, Mason Sanders (McMurtry President), Rachel
Sterling (Martel Senator). Ex-officio: Dr. Josh Eyler (Director, Center for Teaching Excellence), Dr.
Matt Taylor (Associate Vice Provost).</p>

<p>Process: The IUT WG was convened in September 2013, and met weekly with various key
administrators, faculty members and students during the Fall 2013 semester. In addition, the
group carried out a comprehensive student survey receiving ~600 responses (15% of
undergraduate body) over the 2013 winter break and presented findings and collected student
feedback at the SA Senate during January 2014.</p>

<p>Overview: This final report encompasses guiding principles determined by the undergraduate
body on the topic of innovation in undergraduate teaching, as well as specific findings and
recommendations. Included in Appendix A (accessible at sa.rice.edu/reports) are in-depth results
from the survey the IUT WG conducted.</p>

                    <p>Membership: Lily Wen, Eileen Huang, Jocelin Chen,Tim Wang, Sawyer Knight</p>

<p>Mission: TeachMe is an educational company hoping to minimize the gap between inexperienced teachers and more experienced teachers. It strives to lessen new teachers’ anxiety when they first step into classrooms by offering a network of support as well as familiarize old teachers with current technology. It is an organization providing innovative features and gadgets online. By targeting the K-12 market, TeachMe envisions a future in which teaching is more efficient, more engaging, and more effective. </p>

<p>Introduction: Currently society is experiencing a major overturn in the workforce reflected by an inflow of younger employees. These younger employees are largely concentrated in some of the lower-achieving schools in the nation as a result of the “revolving door effect”[5]. As inexperienced teachers, they are faced with problems such as creating effective curricula, collaborating with their coworkers as well as establishing classroom-management skills. [4] Due to the lack of resources that help these teachers in these areas, the students become the subjects of experiment, resulting in a decline in the quality of education. To solve this problem, there must be a new tool.</p> 

<p>TeachMe, is an online database and forum that targets the K-12 Market. The convenient website allows new teachers to immediately come in contact with other teachers, perform filtered searches on related topics, and share popular ideas or tips. TeachMe includes 3 distinct gadgets: RememberMe- a tool that creates individual student profiles for teachers to remember them and track their growth, MeetMe- a video conferencing tool for teachers from across the globe to meet face to face, and AskMe- a polling tool for teachers to receive opinions and have their questions answered.</p>
