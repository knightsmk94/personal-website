                    <h3>Rice Education of the Future Initiative</h3>
                    <p>Stemming from the Student Vision for the Second Century (SV2C), and the Innovation in Undergraduate Teaching (IUT) working group, the Rice Education of the Future (REF) initiative was chartered in October 2014 by the Student Association to address key aspects of the undergraduate experience, including academics, extracurriculars, mentorship, and social life. It has been geared toward aligning the Rice experience with the current priorities and needs of students through the consideration of the following two questions: 
                        <p><ol>
                            <li>How can we change the holistic Rice experience to include the activities and experiences students derive the most value from, preparing them for the challenges of the 21st century?</li>
                            <li>How can we do this in a way that re-aligns the current Rice experience, rather than adding to and overwhelming it?</li>
                        </ol></p>

                    <h3>Student Association Working Group on Innovation in Undergraduate Teaching (IUT WG)</h3>
                    <p>Charge: The IUT WG was charged by the Student Association (SA) Senate to develop,
communicate and issue recommendations on emerging topics falling under the umbrella of
innovation in undergraduate teaching, including teaching excellence, the use of technology to
enhance the undergraduate experience, and the external use of digital education including
‘massive open online courses’ (MOOCs).</p>

<p>Committee Membership: Ravi Sheth (Chair, SA EVP), Yuan Chang, Hannah Chen, Michael
Donatti (Duncan Senator), Fran Iyer (Undergraduate Representative, University Committee on
Teaching), Sawyer Knight, Josh Lipschultz, Mason Sanders (McMurtry President), Rachel
Sterling (Martel Senator). Ex-officio: Dr. Josh Eyler (Director, Center for Teaching Excellence), Dr.
Matt Taylor (Associate Vice Provost).</p>

<p>Process: The IUT WG was convened in September 2013, and met weekly with various key
administrators, faculty members and students during the Fall 2013 semester. In addition, the
group carried out a comprehensive student survey receiving ~600 responses (15% of
undergraduate body) over the 2013 winter break and presented findings and collected student
feedback at the SA Senate during January 2014.</p>

<p>Overview: This final report encompasses guiding principles determined by the undergraduate
body on the topic of innovation in undergraduate teaching, as well as specific findings and
recommendations. Included in Appendix A are in-depth results
from the survey the IUT WG conducted.</p>

                    <h3>TeachMe</h3>
                    <p>Membership: Lily Wen, Eileen Huang, Jocelin Chen,Tim Wang, Sawyer Knight</p>

<p>Mission: TeachMe is an educational company hoping to minimize the gap between inexperienced teachers and more experienced teachers. It strives to lessen new teachers’ anxiety when they first step into classrooms by offering a network of support as well as familiarize old teachers with current technology. It is an organization providing innovative features and gadgets online. By targeting the K-12 market, TeachMe envisions a future in which teaching is more efficient, more engaging, and more effective. </p>

<p>Introduction: Currently society is experiencing a major overturn in the workforce reflected by an inflow of younger employees. These younger employees are largely concentrated in some of the lower-achieving schools in the nation as a result of the “revolving door effect”[5]. As inexperienced teachers, they are faced with problems such as creating effective curricula, collaborating with their coworkers as well as establishing classroom-management skills. [4] Due to the lack of resources that help these teachers in these areas, the students become the subjects of experiment, resulting in a decline in the quality of education. To solve this problem, there must be a new tool.</p> 

<p>TeachMe, is an online database and forum that targets the K-12 Market. The convenient website allows new teachers to immediately come in contact with other teachers, perform filtered searches on related topics, and share popular ideas or tips. TeachMe includes 3 distinct gadgets: RememberMe- a tool that creates individual student profiles for teachers to remember them and track their growth, MeetMe- a video conferencing tool for teachers from across the globe to meet face to face, and AskMe- a polling tool for teachers to receive opinions and have their questions answered.</p>

                    <h3>OpenStax Case Study</h3>
                    <p>Membership: Lily Wen, Eileen Huang, Jocelin Chen,Tim Wang, Sawyer Knight</p>

<p>Mission: As a non-profit organization initiated by Rice University, OpenStax offers free online textbooks to expand access to high quality learning for students. These textbooks are written by professors and credited content developers to ensure top-notch quality. Currently OpenStax offers College Physics, Introduction to Sociology, Biology, Concepts of Biology, Anatomy and Physiology, and Introduction to Statistic. OpenStax projects to expand rapidly within the next few years. </p>

<p>Introduction: OpenStax aims to enter the mainstream market and revolutionize the textbook market. OpenStax uses Creative Commons Licensing, which places the content of Introduction to Sociology under public domain; every aspect of the textbook is free to share and personalize. Also, OpenStax offers Introduction to Sociology in many different platforms, such as iBook, print, and pdf. </p> 

<p>In order to do this, we detailed a concrete set of goals to help facilitate this process. The ideas were then brough to the Director of OpenStax College: Dr. Richard Baraniuk. </p>
<p> We determined the following as key ways to help bridge the gap into the mainstream textbook market: At this point in Introduction to Sociology and OpenStax’s development, gathering widespread attention on the textbook constitutes the most important goal. Extensive recognition of the textbook and the OpenStax system will significantly increase the textbook’s adoption rates. The following is a detailed plan to achieve this goal:
    <p> <ol>
                            <li>Establish Familiarity and a Pool of Student Advocates</li>
                            <li>Gently Nudge Student Advocates to Recommend OpenStax for Professors</li>
                            <li>Gather Information and Take Specific Actions:</li>
                        </ol></p>

<h3>AIDS Foundation Houston Case Study</h3>
                    <p>Membership: Zohra Baig, Reilly Brooks, Blessing Falade, Allison Yu, Sawyer Knight</p>

<p>Introduction: During the Leading Edge Workshop held at Rice University, participants were given two hours to provide a solution for an assigned organization. </p> 

<p>Mission: AIDS Foundation Houston, Inc. (AFH) is a nonprofit corporation founded in 1982 as Texas’ first organization dedicated to HIV prevention education and services. AFH has steadily evolved from a grass-roots community agency to a professionally managed human services organization that provides many services including benefits and resources counseling, case management, housing, and food and nutrition assistance to low-income, HIV+ men, women, and children.  </p>

<p>Problem: Through tremendous medical advancements over the past 30 years, HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence; however, due to socioeconomic barriers including access to healthcare, costs of medications, stigma and poverty, it remains a danger to the health of our community. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy states that linkage coordination is essential when and where HIV screening is provided to help overcome these barriers to obtaining care; this is accomplished through the collaborative efforts of AIDS Service Organizations and healthcare providers. AFH proposes to conduct a community assessment to establish a seamless system to provide coordinated care to people living with HIV through a strategically constructed community network of various care providers.</p>
<p>Solution: This collaboration will follow the stages of the HIV Care Continuum, a model that outlines the stages of HIV medical care that people living with HIV go through from initial diagnosis to achieving the goal of viral suppression. It will do so because it immediately links HIV positive individuals into the treatment and counseling needed to help them stay healthy and less likely to pass the virus on to others. By identifying gaps and implementing improvements, we can increase the proportion of people living with HIV who are prescribed ART and are able to stay engaged in HIV medical care and adhere to their treatment so that they can achieve viral load suppression. The planning and implementation of a collaborative network can provide the holistic care needed to impact this population and prevent new infections, identify and address weaknesses in service provision caused by a lack of funding, or barriers to obtaining healthcare and other
critical services, and design a network and program which can be studied and replicated
nationwide.<p>

<h2>Service</h2>
<p>From Haiti to South Africa or even here in Texas, there are many memorable experiences of service that hold significant impact in my heart. Service is a huge contributor to my joy. I believe an aspect of life is that we are all called to serve others and not to be served, whether in the workplace, in our local community, or around the world.</p>
<h3>South Africa</h3>
<p>In my trip to South Africa over spring break, I was a part of a group of seven high school students and three adults who traveled over 9,000 miles to teach life skills and volunteer through Genesis of Norwegian Settlers Church. I believe that there is a component of education which needs to take place not only for helping people with illness or tragedy, but that breaks down any barriers people may have. As a team, we were able to teach basic life skills in health education, relationship values, and sexual and STD education to 8th graders. The students were amazed at the information we gave them regarding the likelihood of transmitting or getting STD’s. I find it important to serve and to educate to provide the best outlook for better understanding and not only of health related issues but in general.</p> 

<p>Another particular memory that stands out occurred on our trip to Rehoboth Orphanage. This place is specifically for orphans who are HIV or AIDS positive. We aided in the care of over 50 children through soccer games, tag, basketball, and wiffleball. My heart goes out for their compassionate smiles and energy to just play. The highlight of the trip was when one blind boy, Apeeway, sang Amazing Grace with tremor to bring us to our knees. The joy and fullness of my heart in this moment was tremendous, but there remains a stigma around the disease that affects or infects all of them: AIDS. We saw this first hand as one child scraped their knee and immediately ran back to his designated house. He was ashamed. I find it important to serve and to educate younger generations to provide the best outlook for better understanding and preventing these diseases. I get a sense of fulfillment in knowing that in some way these students now have a working understanding of the truth behind these diseases. This fulfillment has fueled a desire to raise awareness of the lack of education on such topics. I hope to break down false stereotypes behind diseases such as HIV and AIDS to promote the best possible care for everyone facing diseases that are unseen or “ghost” diseases such as the children at Rehoboth.</p>

<h3>Haiti</h3>
<p>During the summer of 2012 I was an active member of the High School Ministry at Lake Pointe Church in Rockwall, Texas. During this time, the high school pastor established a relationship with underserved communities through good works by reaching out to Mission of Hope, an organization that connects faith­based organizations with international relief efforts in Haiti.  Through the efforts of Mission of Hope, Lake Pointe Church adopted the village of Terpin in the mountains of Haiti. This was my first mission trip and one which would really turn my sense of accomplishment and future goals towards having a service­oriented heart. Lake Pointe Church strives to promote the idea of self­sustaining relief in this area. The goal is to break down the stigma that these people solely rely on the handouts. I was able to help rebuild a school in Terpin and help the Haitian people feel a sense of value to their village, which had been subject to the destruction caused by the 2010 earthquake. This tragedy manifests itself in the form of amputees wandering the streets and children with swollen bellies from malnourishment. Windowless buildings with no electricity or air conditioning led to the continued poor sanitary and environmental conditions that we sought to fix. I was able to help package and distribute food, mosquito nets, and other supplies to the leader of the village. The Haitian people are able to help themselves and rebuild while slowly overcoming their huge health and economic disadvantages. I find immense fulfillment knowing that I was able to feed them not just for a day, but to help them feed and take care of themselves for years to come. I learned that this same issue occurs in the United States just as often with tragedies such as Hurricanes Katrina and Ike. Providing for needs and helping others is only half of the battle. The other half is creating sustainability.</p>

<h3>Nicaragua</h3>
<p>In May of 2015, I traveled to Nicaragua as a member of Rice University's Global Medical Brigades Chapter. As a whole, our brigade was a hybrid medical and public health brigade. Our team of 32 students and 7 doctors and dentists saw 888 patients in the community of San Gabriel and built hygeine stations for three different families. I also partook as a keynote speaker in our Regional Exchange conference in  TED style speeches, my topic being on the importance of Faith in Service and Healthcare. This experience allowed me to witness how university students can truly work to establish a sustainable partnership with these people. The communities we worked with raised 10% of the funds for the trip to combine with the $2,000 of my personal fundraising and collective fundraising through outside events to meet our $64,000 goal. The first three days were spent in the town of San Gabriel. I was able to help with patient intake and triage, consultation with the doctors and patients, filling of medications and explaining the directions, teaching dental and water hygeine to children waiting to be seen, perform fluoride treatment, as well as the creation of digital data informatics so that Global Brigades will have a working database for this area should any of the patients require follow ups when another brigade returns. It is quite an honor to be able to use the skills I currently have in order to work towards the greater goal of equal chances for healthcare aroun the globe. The people were incredibly grateful and truly displayed a sense of resiliency that is unmatched. I am able to better understand how investing in younger generations and those in need will create a self-sustaining world where everyone can fluorish. The next two days spent building three hygeine stations for different families. I quickly became quite experienced with concrete and cinder blocks. We laid the concrete foundation followed by the shower and toilet stalls, which consisted of mixing concrete and laying them brick and mortar until it reached about 7 feet tall. We also installed a concrete wash basin. The finishing touch was working on aligning PVC pipes which trained the toilet into the 1'x9'x5' septic tank we build earlier in the day. Again, the largest lesson learned is just how precious water and basic needs really are. The conviction of this project is the importance of water and basic necessities. Truly, the act of servanthood is the greatest of graces that we may put down our own desires in order to promote the idea that everyone may one day be in the position to experience the grace of serving each other.</p>
